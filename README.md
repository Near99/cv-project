# CV Generator from The Odin Project

### I hate styling more than anything

1. This is the first React project. Had a lot of fun writting this little project with React.

2. Used Styled Components which is really good.

3. Was planning to make this project a bit more "usable" but due to the unfortunate css skill of mine that preventing me from making the page more attractive which caused me having no interests to add more functionalities and so I decided to let it be.

4. Code is not DRY. I repeated myself all the time. Code is ugly.

### What has been done so far?

1. Able to edit name, profile, contact info, add skills, eduction, career, and update it synchronously in the cv preview on the right side.

2. Able to remove skills by pressing shiftkey and click it.

3. Able to remove all eduction and career.

### What has not been done?

1. Unable to edit added eduction and career.

2. Can't upload new profile picture.

3. Page layout is super ugly.

4. Maximum career and eduction supported are two, more will cause left side div to overflow and I have no idea why.

5. Can't export pdf file.

### What to do next?

1. Don't think I will do anything to it in the next few days.

2. Gonna do some more projects with react and learn more CSS...

3. Again styling is really the pain in the ass.
